This directory contains assembled sequence data, newick formatted tree files, code and scripts for generating and analyzing phylogenetic informativeness, probe design, and notes on data assembly. Code used for generating figures is available on request.


~/Trees/Townsend_guideTreeA/ contains the ten tree files generated by analyses of the ten datasets filtered using the median changepoint of QIHP (with site rates from guide tree A)

~/Trees/Townsend_guideTreeB/ contains the ten tree files generated by analyses of the ten datasets filtered using the median changepoint of QIHP (with site rates from guide tree B)

~/Trees/All_data_genetrees/ contains the gene tree estimated for each locus used for the ASTRAL analyses

~/Trees/ contains the final tree files generated by our analyses

~/Site_rates/ contains site rates generated under guide tree A and guide tree B

~/Alignments/ contains the concatenated alignment of all 132 loci, an alignment of amino acid translations, an alignment removing third positions, and an alignment with 3rd positions RY coded.

~/Alignments/GuideTreeATenSets/ contains ten alignments generated by filtering data based on the median changepoint of QIHP and guidetreeA

~/Alignments/GuideTreeBTenSets/ contains ten alignments generated by filtering data based on the median changepoint of QIHP and guidetreeB

~/Assembly/ contains the individual locus alignments for the trimmed data in nexus format
